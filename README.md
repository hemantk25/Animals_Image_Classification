# Animals_Image_Classification
# Animal Classification Using CNN
This project classifies animals into 15 categories using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

## Dataset
- 15 classes of animals
- Each image is 224x224 pixels.

## How to Run
- Upload the dataset in Google Colab.
- Train the model.
- Test with sample images.
- Save the model as `animal_classification_model.h5`.

## Results
- Validation Accuracy: XYZ%
- Example Predictions:
  - Image: `Lion` -> Predicted: `Lion`
  - Image: `Tiger` -> Predicted: `Tiger`
